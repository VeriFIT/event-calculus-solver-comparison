happens(hitGround(apple),3)
happens(drop(nathan,apple),0)
holdsAt(falling(apple),(0<T=<3))
releasedAt(height(apple),(0<T=<3))
fholdsAt(height(apple)=0,(3<T=<5))
fholdsAtC(height(apple)=(3->0),(0<T=<3),eq(((1,3),-1)))
Assignment:
(obs,0)=0 (time,0)=0 (time,1)=3 (time,2)=5 (height(apple),0)=3 (height(apple),1)=0 (height(apple),2)=0
