% --> abduce happens steal after park (time between 20 and 40), i.e., in step 2 (initial is step 0, end is step 2)
% NOTE: the example gives no time information for step 1 --> clingo-lpx says time(2)=40-e (happened "some" short time before time 40)
% NOTE: clingcon needs --project for the same reason, otherwise would give many models of all possible placements
