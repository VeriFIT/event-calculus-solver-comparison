happens(hitGround(apple),20)
happens(drop(nathan,apple),10)
holdsAt(falling(apple),(10,"< T =<",20))
releasedAt(height(apple),(10,"< T =<",20))
fholdsAt(height(apple),20,(0,"< T =<",10))
fholdsAt(height(apple),0,(10,"< T =<",20))
fholdsAt(height(apple),0,(20,"< T =<",1000))
Assignment: [leftovers]
fholdsAt(height(apple),0)=20
